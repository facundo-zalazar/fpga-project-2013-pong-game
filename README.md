# fpga-project-2013-pong-game
My FPGA Project for third year of Electronic Engineering. It uses a Altera DE1 board.

Documentation is in spanish.

To edit it and run it, you need Quartus software (i donÂ´t remember what version i used) and also an Altera board. 

Here you have a link to watch a video of the project running.
